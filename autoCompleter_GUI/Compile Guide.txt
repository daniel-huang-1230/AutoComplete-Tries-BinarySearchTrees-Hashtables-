What does this do?
	An GUI for UCSD Winter 2016 CSE 100 PA3. It mimics a search bar with 
	autocomplete functionality (which will be implemented by students)
	
How to compile?
	Linux: 
		Once inside the GUI file's folder (where AutoCreator.pro resides)
		> qmake AutoCreator.pro 
			# Note to class users: Version of Qt matters. 
			# Use the one in /software/common64/qt-5.5.0/bin
    		> make
    		
    	Windows:
    		Assuming you are using a Qt with MinGW, run 
    		> mingw32-make
		instead of make.
		
		On my Windows system I had to move a couple .dll-s from Qt's bin
		folder to where the binaries are. Not sure if we need 
		this step for Mac. -- Huajie
